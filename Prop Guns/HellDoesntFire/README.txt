The fire-control group of this object is solid and un-machined with no holes or dimples for the selector, trigger, or hammer pins. 


This object does not meet the definition of a "firearm", and so is not regulated under the Gun Control Act.



This object will accept an AR-15 buffer tube and stock, grip, magazine, and upper, but will not accept a trigger, hammer, auto-sear, or safety. 

This object is NOT a firearm, even when fully assembled.
